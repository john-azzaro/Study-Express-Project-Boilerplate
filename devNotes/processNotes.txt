Process Notes for Express Project Boilerplate
=============================================




About Process Notes
===================
"Process Notes" is a step-by-step workflow document that outlines the "phases" of my study/app development and the successive steps taken at each
milestone of the examination. In the case of studies, the process notes might be eschewed in favor of the main Readme document in the repository, 
mostly because of the advantage in formatting and accessibility. However, I will put additional notes and resource links that might be helpful. In 
the case of application development, groups of related steps are combined into "phase" modules so that they can be reorganized and refined in 
post-review. This has proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in learning (i.e. Feynman technique (https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)) and refining 
workflow so I can improve my process in future projects. It also has come in handy for some tricky bug fixes not only for past projects, but this 
one as well so I would urge you to consider at least doing a rough summary for your own benefit.

Phase 1: Project Setup
=========================================================================================
-- Setting up your project lays the foundation for the rest fo the project. The initial 
   steps involve installing npm, dependencies, development environment setup, and 
   essential files like server.js, .gitignore, and .env.
=========================================================================================

/// Project Setup:                           
        1.1:  Issue-Index-App                                     -- Create a folder to store you application.
        1.2:  npm init                                            -- Create a package.json file to start the project off.

/// Install express:
        1.3:  npm install express                                 -- Install express.
        1.4:  .gitignore > node_modules                           -- Tell git to ignore node_modules folder.

/// Install developer environment:                
        1.5:  npm install --save-dev dotenv nodemon               -- Install development enviroment.

/// Create custom "devStart" script in package.json:     
        1.6:  "devStart": "nodemon server.js"                     -- Run development environment (npm run devStart).
        1.7:  "start": "node server.js"                           -- Run server normally in a production environment (npm run start).
        
/// Create initial application files:       
        1.8:   server.js                                          -- Create main server file.
